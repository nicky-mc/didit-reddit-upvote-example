# Reflection

## Introduction

This project was an opportunity to join an existing codebase and contribute meaningfully by improving its functionality and user experience. The app, modeled after social platforms like Reddit or Hacker News, provided a real-world scenario where I could learn to navigate, enhance, and fix an unfamiliar system.

## Goals Achieved

### 1. **Fix Page Titles on Post Pages**

- **Objective**: Ensure that each post's page dynamically reflects its title in the browser tab.
- **Achievement**: Updated the post page titles to match the post content dynamically, improving both SEO and user experience.
- **Impact**: Users now enjoy a personalized browsing experience, making the app feel more polished and professional.

### 2. **Handle Errors for Unauthorized Actions**

- **Objective**: Display a user-friendly error message when an unauthorized action, like voting without being logged in, is attempted.
- **Achievement**: Implemented an error handling mechanism that prompts users to log in if they attempt to vote without proper authorization.
- **Impact**: Enhanced user experience by reducing confusion and ensuring users understand why certain actions are restricted.

---

### 3. **Prevent Multiple Votes on the Same Post**

- **Objective**: Prevent users from voting multiple times on the same post.
- **Achievement**: Resolved the issue by altering the database schema to enforce a `UNIQUE` constraint on the `votes` table, ensuring:
  - Users can only cast one vote per post.
  - Users cannot both upvote and downvote the same post.
  
  **Schema Fix:**
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE votes
  ADD CONSTRAINT unique_user_post_vote UNIQUE (user_id, post_id);

### Impact:
This fix improved data integrity and prevented abuse of the voting system, ensuring fair and consistent voting behavior.

## Challenges Faced and Lessons Learned
###1. Database Schema Changes
Altering the database schema was challenging but crucial for enforcing business rules at the data level.
Lesson: Schema-level constraints are essential for maintaining data integrity and reducing the complexity of application logic.
###2. Error Handling and User Experience
Enhancing error handling improved the app's usability and user trust.
###Lesson: 
Meaningful and clear error messages are crucial for guiding users through their interactions with the app.
###3. Understanding an Existing Codebase

Joining a pre-existing project required quickly familiarizing myself with its architecture and patterns.
##Lesson: 
A methodical approach and effective documentation are critical when navigating unfamiliar code.
Reflections on the Experience
This project taught me valuable lessons in:

##Database Design: 
Leveraging constraints at the schema level to enforce business rules effectively.
##User Experience: 
Small changes like dynamic titles and error messages can significantly enhance usability.
##Collaborative Development: 
Working within an existing system requires balancing innovation with respect for established practices.
#Conclusion
Overall, this assignment provided a comprehensive learning experience, from enhancing functionality to improving user experience. The lessons learned here will be invaluable in future collaborative projects, especially when contributing to ongoing development efforts.
